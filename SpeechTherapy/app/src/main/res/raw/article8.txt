<p>This guide is intended to enable Romanians to become aware of these mistakes and to avoid these slip-ups. This is a guide to British English in particular.

<h5>”It’s my sister.”</h5>
</p>
____________________________________
<p>
A sister must be referred to as ‘she’. It is very impolite to call a person ‘it’. The word ‘it’ is an impersonal pronoun.
‘It’ is for a common noun or abstract noun perhaps.
‘She’ is the feminine personal pronoun when used as the subject of the sentence. For example ‘She is my sister’ or ‘she went to Canada.’
The passive personal pronoun is ‘her’ When the female person is the object of the sentence one uses ‘her’ for example ‘Do you know her?’ or
‘I met her in Canada.’
Likewise ‘he’ is the male personal pronoun when used as the subject of the sentence. For instance ‘he is a nice guy’ or ‘he is from New Zealand.’
‘Him’ is the male personal pronoun when used as the object of the sentence. For example ‘I like talking to him’ or ‘Give this bag to him please.’
It can be used for animals. However, if you know the sex of the animal it is acceptable to use she or he.

<h5>The ‘th’ sound.</h5>
<p>
Tis sound is made by putting one’s tongue just in front of one’s teeth.
Think of a snake sticking its tongue out and making that hissing noise. The noise is not ‘sssssss’ it is ‘thththth’.
The th sound does not exist in other languages besides Arabic as in the word ‘thibuan’ meaning ‘snake’. Maybe it is onompatopaeic.
Many Native speakers of English cannot make the ‘th’ sound. In Southern Ireland and southern England many people, especially the
less educated, do not make this sound.
The working class in London cannot pronounce the ‘th’ sound. Instead of  ‘thanks’ they say ‘fanks.’
Instead of ‘brother’ they may say ‘bruder’ in Ireland or ‘brover’ in England.
The lack of a ‘th’ sound is a dead giveaway that someone is not a native speaker of English.

<h5>‘Five and a half o’clock’.</h5>

Do not say this say ‘half past five’. ‘Five thirty’ is equally good. Never say ‘three and a half’ or ‘eleven and a half’ for the time.
This makes Anglophones think of fractions such as 3 1/2 or 11  1/2.

Here are ways to say the time.
<ul>
<li>1.05 – five past one. Five minutes past one.</li>

<li>1.10 – ten past one. Ten minutes past one.</li>

<li>1.15. One fifteen. A quarter past one.</li>

<li>1.20. Twenty past one. Twenty minutes past one. One twenty.</li>

<li>1.25 Twenty-five past one. Twenty-five minutes past one. One Twenty-five.</li>

<li>1.30. One thirty. Half past one.</li>

<li>1.35. One thirty-five. Thirty five minutes past one. Twenty five to two.</li>

<li>1.40. One forty. Twenty to two. Forty minutes past one.</li>

<li>1.45. A quarter to two. One forty-five. Forty-five minutes past one.</li>

<li>1.50 Ten to two. One fifty. Fifty minutes past one.</li>

<li>1.55 One fifty-five. Five to one. Five minutes to one.</li>
</ul>

<h5>‘The professors at my high school’</h5>
<p>
In English a professor refers only to someone who teaches at a university and has been awarded the title ‘professor.’
In order to be a professor one has to teach at a university for many years.
The word ‘professor’ is a very high honour in the United Kingdom.
People who teach at a secondary school or primary school never get the title professor.

<h5>”I got good notes at school.”</h5>
<p>
A note in English can mean a musical note – as in the sound one has to make. It can mean a piece of writing,
normally very brief to remind oneself of something.
This person wanted to say ‘I got very good grades at school.’
</p>

<h5>”Did I participate to the hour?”</h5>
<p>
This should be ”Did I participate in the lesson?”
An hour is strictly that –  a unit of time of 60 minutes. An hour is not a lesson or vague unit of time.

<h5>”Carmen is the Director of the school.”</h5>
<p>
In the UK the person who is the teacher in charge of the school is entitled the Headmistress in the case of a woman and the Headmaster in the case of a
man. One can use a gender neutral term –  Headteacher. In the United States this person is the Principal.
There may be a Director of Studies at a school but this person is below the Headteacher.
In other contexts the word ‘director’ is fine. For example – company director, theatre director, film director or director of football.
</p>

<h5>”How you say fular?”</h5>
<p>
This person should have phrased the question ‘How do you say fular?”
It is scarf. English does not distinguish between fular and esarfa.
</p>
____________________________________
<h5>”He is so bad to me. He behaves ugly. It is not correct.”</h5>
<p>
This should be ”he is so bad to me. He behaves badly. It is not fair.”
In English ”correct” is strictly about factual accuracy.’Ugly’ is about physical appearance of a person, animal, place or building.
</p>

<h5>”I am going to make a course to improve my English.”</h5>
<p>
This should be I am going to do a course.
”Make” is normally about creating something, constructing it. ”To do” is more like an activity.
</p>

<h5>”I am going to England with a car.”</h5>
<p>
I am going by car. For transport ‘by’ always works – by plane, by boat, by bicycle, by train, by horse and even by foot.
There are other prepositions that sometimes work for transport such as on a boat, on a bicycle, on a horse, in a car or on foot.
However if in doubt use ‘by’ because works for all of them.
<p>

<h5>”I have been to Netherlands, Ukraine and Czech Republic.”</h5>
<p>
‘I have been to the Netherlands, the Ukraine and the Czech Republic.’ Some countries take ‘the’.
These are ones that are plurals or are known by their constitutional title. The Ukraine and the Lebanon are exceptions.

<h5>”What is your motive for coming to the doctor?”</h5>
<p>

<h5>There are many fishes in my fridge.</h5>
<p>
”There are a lot of fish in my fridge.”
Fish is an invariable plural. When it is plural it still behaves like a singular. One fish, two fish etc..
One only says ”fishes” when distinguishing between different species of fish. Many native speakers get this wrong.

<h5>”This weekend I was in mountain” This ought to be as below:</h5>
<p>
This weekend I was in the mountains. ”The mountains” means the mountains in general.
If one wishes to say that one was on one particular mountain one would say ”This weekend I was on a mountain.”</p>

<h5>”The student has had a lot of evolution in the subject.”</h5>
<p>
In English ”evolution” is the process of natural selection as described by Charles Darwin. We seldom use it in any other context.
 In an educational context one should say,”The student has made a lot of progress in the subject.”

Plague is not pronounced ”plaag” to rhyme with Prague. Plague is pronounced ”plaig” to rhyme with ”vague” or ”Haig.”

<h5>”Children whom parents are teachers are not always smart.”</h5>
<p>
This should be ”children whose parents are teachers are not always smart.”
Whom is the object form of ”who”’.
”Whose” is the possessive form of ”who.”
”Whose” which indicates beloning is not to be confused with ”who’s” despite them being prounounced exactly the same.
”Who’s” is a widely accepted contraction of ”who is”. Here is an example, ”Who’s that guy?” This is precisely the same as ”who is that guy?”

<h5>”Branches” is not pronounced ”BRAIN-chez.”</h5>
 <p>It sounds like ”BRAN chz.”
</p>
____________________________________
<h5>”Hidden” is not prounced ”HIDE’n”.</h5>
<p>
It is pronounced ”HID’n”. The letter ‘i’ does not say its name in this word.
The confusing thing is in the present tense the ‘i’ does pronounce its name. ”Hide” rhymes with ”tide” or ”side.”
</p>

<h5>”Ripper” is not pronounced ”RYE-per”.</h5>
 <p>It should be ”RIP – er”.</p>
____________________________________
<h5>”Recipe” must not be pronounced ”ress IPE” to rhyme with ”pipe” or ”skype.”</h5>
