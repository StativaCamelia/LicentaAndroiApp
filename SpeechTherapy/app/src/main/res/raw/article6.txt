Accurate pronunciation is an important part of learning any language, and especially when you’re learning English.
The way your speech sounds can have a big impact on whether or not people understand what you are saying and their initial impression of you.
The tricky thing about pronunciation is that it not just a question of acquiring knowledge, it’s a physical skill that you need to practise regularly.

<h3>How to improve English pronunciation</h3>
<p>
There are no shortcuts to perfect pronunciation, however there are some ways you can practise more effectively and improve your skills faster.
</p>
<h4>Slow down!</h4>
<p>
Many English learners think that speaking fluently means they need to speak fast. This is wrong.
Speaking too fast reinforces bad habits and makes the speaker sound nervous and indecisive.
Speaking slowly <span style="color:#ba6b6c;">will give you time to breathe properly and think about what you want to say next.</span>
Because it gives you time to think while you are speaking, you’ll feel more relaxed and be able to concentrate on making your English sound fantastic.
</p>
<h4>Picture it…</h4>
<p>
Close your eyes and think about how to make a sound before saying it. <span style="color:#ba6b6c;">Visualize the positioning of your mouth and face.</span>
If you have studied with the phonemic chart, <span style="color:#ba6b6c;">think about the sound you are making and how it relates to other English phonemes.</span>
If you have used diagrams of the mouth and tongue, think about the shape you need to make inside your mouth if you want to make the sound correctly.
</p>
<h4>Get physical!</h4>
<p>
Pronunciation is a physical skill. You’re teaching your mouth a new way to move and using different muscles.
<span style="color:#ba6b6c;">Focus on difficult sounds each day.<span> Having trouble with ‘th’?
Put your tongue between your teeth (don’t bite down) and blow air out of your mouth. Feel the air move over the top of your tongue.
</p>
<h4>Watch yourself</h4>
<p>
Stand in front of a mirror to <span style="color:#ba6b6c;">see the placement of your tongue, lips, and shape of your mouth when you make certain sounds.</span>
Compare what you see with a video of a native-speaker saying the same thing.
</p>

<h4>Copy the experts</h4>
<p>
There’s no replacement for learning pronunciation from the experts – native-speakers.
So listen! <span style="color:#ba6b6c;">Listen to English radio programs and watch television and movies in English.</span>
Imitate what you’re hearing – even if you’re not sure what they’re saying yet.
</p>
<h4>Practice English alone</h4>
<p>
Pronunciation problems persist because we’re afraid to make mistakes.
<span style="color:#ba6b6c;">Create scenarios – meeting someone for the first time, ordering at a restaurant, asking for directions </span>– then act out the dialogue by yourself.
 Don’t be shy.
</p>
<h4>Find a language buddy</h4>
<p>
Getting feedback from an outside observer is crucial.<span style="color:#ba6b6c;"> Find a friend who’s also interested in improving their English.</span>
Try exchanging recorded messages so you can listen closely to each other’s pronunciation.
</p>
<h4>Pay attention to intonation and stress</h4>
<p>
Good pronunciation is more than just mastering individual sounds.
It’s also understanding intonation (the rise and fall of the voice)
and stress (some sounds in words and some words in sentences are louder or clearer than others).
<span style="color:#ba6b6c;">Read poems, speeches and songs aloud, concentrating on the word stress and intonation.</span>
</p>
<h4>Sing a song!</h4>
<p>
<span style="color:#ba6b6c;">Learn the words to popular English songs and sing along.</span> Singing helps you relax and just get those words out, as well as helping your
rhythm and intonation. Because you don’t need to concentrate on constructing sentences for yourself, you can concentrate on
making your pronunciation sound great!
